## Test Plan for Enhanced Validation Feedback

### What we've improved:

1. **Specific Error Messages**: Instead of "Please fill in all required fields", users now get detailed feedback about exactly which fields are missing or invalid.

2. **Better Error Display**: The FeedbackModal now:
   - Shows multi-line error messages properly
   - Has different icons for errors vs success
   - Has longer timeout for error messages (8 seconds vs 3 seconds)
   - Has a manual "Close" button for error messages

3. **Debug Information**: Added console logging to help identify validation issues during development.

### Testing Steps:

1. **Test Missing Required Fields**:
   - Go to profile setup
   - Leave some required fields empty (like name, email, etc.)
   - Try to proceed to next step
   - Should see specific error messages listing which fields are missing

2. **Test Conditional Fields**:
   - Select "Other" in past medical history but don't fill the specification
   - Select "Yes" for hospital admission but don't fill details
   - Select "Food Allergies" but don't specify which foods
   - Try to proceed - should see specific errors for each missing specification

3. **Test Format Validation**:
   - Enter invalid email format
   - Enter invalid phone number (not starting with 09 or wrong length)
   - Try to proceed - should see specific format error messages

4. **Test Console Debugging**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Try to submit with missing fields
   - Should see detailed logging of validation process

### Expected Behavior:

- Error message will list specific fields that need attention
- Each error will have a user-friendly field name
- Modal will stay open longer for errors
- Users can manually close error modals
- Console will show detailed validation information for debugging

### Test the changes by:
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/patient/profile-setup
2. Try submitting incomplete forms
3. Check that error messages are specific and helpful
4. Verify console logs show detailed validation information
