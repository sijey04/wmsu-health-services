# Patient Semester System Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of semester-specific patient profiles in the WMSU Health Services system. The system now supports distinct patient profiles for each semester period (First Semester, Second Semester, Summer Semester) within an academic year.

## Changes Made

### 1. Patient Model Updates

#### New Fields Added:
- **`semester`**: CharField with choices for semester periods
  - `'1st_semester'` - First Semester
  - `'2nd_semester'` - Second Semester  
  - `'summer'` - Summer Semester

#### Updated Constraints:
- **Unique Together**: Changed from `['user', 'school_year']` to `['user', 'school_year', 'semester']`
- **Database Index**: Updated to include semester field for optimized queries

#### New Methods:
- **`get_semester_display()`**: Returns human-readable semester name
- **`is_current_semester_patient()`**: Checks if profile is for current semester
- **Updated `save()`**: Auto-determines semester based on current date

### 2. CustomUser Model Updates

#### Updated Methods:
- **`get_current_patient_profile()`**: Now returns profile for current school year AND semester
- **`get_or_create_patient_profile()`**: Now accepts both school_year and semester parameters

### 3. DentalWaiver Model Updates

#### New Fields Added:
- **`patient`**: ForeignKey to Patient model
- **`school_year`**: ForeignKey to AcademicSchoolYear model
- **`semester`**: CharField for semester period
- **`guardian_name`**: Renamed from `parent_guardian_name`
- **`guardian_signature`**: Renamed from `parent_guardian_signature`

#### Removed Fields:
- **`residence`**: No longer needed
- **`witness_signature`**: Simplified signature process
- **`parent_guardian_name`**: Renamed to `guardian_name`
- **`parent_guardian_signature`**: Renamed to `guardian_signature`

#### Updated Constraints:
- **Unique Constraint**: Changed from per-user to per-user-semester: `['user', 'school_year', 'semester']`

#### New Methods:
- **`get_semester_display()`**: Returns human-readable semester name
- **Updated `save()`**: Auto-assigns school year, semester, and patient profile

## Database Migrations

### Migration 0046: Add Semester to Patient
- Adds `semester` field to Patient model
- Updates unique constraint to include semester
- Updates database index for optimized queries

### Migration 0047: Update DentalWaiver with Semester
- Adds semester support to DentalWaiver model
- Removes unnecessary fields
- Renames guardian-related fields for consistency
- Updates unique constraint to be semester-specific

## Impact on System Behavior

### Patient Profile Management
- **Before**: One patient profile per user per academic year
- **After**: One patient profile per user per semester (up to 3 per academic year)

### Dental Waiver System
- **Before**: One dental waiver per user (lifetime)
- **After**: One dental waiver per user per semester

### Appointment System
- Appointments are now linked to semester-specific patient profiles
- Better tracking of health data across different academic periods

## API Changes

### Patient Endpoints
- Patient creation now considers current semester
- Profile lookup returns semester-specific data
- Bulk operations respect semester boundaries

### Dental Waiver Endpoints
- Waiver status checks are semester-specific
- Multiple waivers per user possible (one per semester)
- Check status endpoint returns current semester waiver status

## Frontend Integration

### Patient Profile Setup
- Users may need to create/update profiles each semester
- Profile data can be carried forward from previous semesters
- Clear indication of which semester the profile applies to

### Dental Appointment Booking
- Waiver checks are semester-specific
- Users may need to sign waiver again for new semesters
- Clear messaging about semester-specific requirements

## Benefits

### For Students
- **Accurate Health Tracking**: Health data reflects current semester status
- **Flexible Updates**: Can update information each semester as needed
- **Privacy**: Previous semester data is preserved separately

### For Health Services Staff
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation of data by academic periods
- **Improved Reporting**: Semester-specific health statistics
- **Compliance**: Better tracking of waiver compliance per semester

### For System Administration
- **Data Integrity**: Reduced data conflicts between academic periods
- **Scalability**: System handles multiple academic periods efficiently
- **Audit Trail**: Clear history of health data changes per semester

## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing patient profiles without semester assignment will continue to work
- Migration scripts handle data transition safely
- No data loss during the upgrade process

### Automatic Semester Detection
- System auto-detects current semester based on academic year configuration
- Falls back gracefully if semester dates are not configured
- Manual semester assignment possible for edge cases

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexes optimized for semester-aware queries
- Efficient lookup of current semester data
- Minimal impact on existing query performance

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Semester Data Rollover**: Automatic copying of relevant data to new semester
2. **Semester Comparison**: Tools to compare health data across semesters
3. **Bulk Semester Operations**: Mass operations across semester boundaries
4. **Semester Analytics**: Advanced reporting and analytics per semester

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Academic System Integration**: Sync with university enrollment systems
2. **Health Trend Analysis**: Track health changes across semesters
3. **Predictive Health Monitoring**: Identify patterns across academic periods

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test semester auto-detection logic
- Test patient profile creation with semesters
- Test dental waiver semester constraints

### Integration Tests
- Test appointment booking with semester-specific profiles
- Test waiver workflow across semester boundaries
- Test data migration scripts

### User Acceptance Tests
- Test profile setup for new semesters
- Test dental waiver signing for new semesters
- Test staff dashboard with semester filtering

## Deployment Instructions

### Database Migration
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Verification Steps
1. Check that existing patient profiles are preserved
2. Verify semester auto-detection works correctly
3. Test dental waiver creation for current semester
4. Confirm unique constraints are enforced

### Rollback Plan
- Migration 0047 can be rolled back if needed
- Migration 0046 should be tested thoroughly before deployment
- Backup database before applying migrations

## Conclusion

The semester system implementation provides a more granular and accurate way to manage patient health data in alignment with the academic calendar. This enhancement improves data organization, compliance tracking, and provides better insights into student health patterns throughout their academic journey.

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while introducing powerful new capabilities for semester-specific health data management.
