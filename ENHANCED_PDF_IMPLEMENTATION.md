## Summary

This implementation adds professional PDF generation and viewing capabilities for completed appointment form data (both dental and medical examinations) in the WMSU Health Services system.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Enhancements

#### 1. Enhanced PDF Generation (`api/pdf_utils.py`)
- **Professional Layout**: Redesigned PDF layout to fit content on a single page
- **Compact Design**: Reduced margins and optimized spacing
- **Two-Column Layout**: Efficient use of space with side-by-side sections
- **Enhanced Styling**:

  - Grid-based tables for structured data presentation
  - Consistent typography with Helvetica fonts
  - Color-coded headers and sections
  - Professional footer with examiner information

#### 2. New API Endpoints (`api/views.py`)
Added to `AppointmentViewSet`:

- **`view_form_data/`** (GET): View PDF inline in browser
  - Content-Disposition: `inline` for browser viewing
  - Generates PDF on-the-fly from appointment form data
  
- **`download_form_data/`** (GET): Download PDF file
  - Content-Disposition: `attachment` for file download
  - Same PDF generation with download trigger

- **`has_form_data/`** (GET): Check if appointment has associated form data
  - Returns boolean flag and form type

#### 3. Enhanced Serializer (`api/serializers.py`)
Updated `AppointmentSerializer` with:
- `has_form_data`: Boolean field indicating if appointment has form data
- `form_type`: String field indicating type ('dental' or 'medical')

### Frontend Enhancements

Added new appointment API methods:
