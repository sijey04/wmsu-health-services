## Key Features

### üìã Appointment Limits
- **20 appointments per day maximum** per campus
- **20-minute time intervals** for all appointments

- **Future Dates Only**: Appointments must be scheduled at least 1 day in advance (max 30 days)

### üéØ Time Slot Management
- Appointments start at 8:00 AM and continue in 20-minute intervals
- Valid time slots: 8:00, 8:20, 8:40, 9:00, 9:20, etc.
- Automatically excludes lunch break (12:00-1:00 PM)

## Validation Rules

### ‚úÖ Date Validation
- Must be a future date (at least tomorrow)
- Maximum 30 days in advance
- Weekdays only (Monday-Friday)

### ‚úÖ Time Validation
- Must be within working hours (8:00 AM - 5:00 PM)
- Must not be during lunch break (12:00-1:00 PM)
- Must be a valid 20-minute interval slot
- Time slot must not already be booked

### ‚úÖ Capacity Validation
- Maximum 20 appointments per day per campus
- Each time slot can only have one appointment

## Error Responses

The system provides detailed error messages for validation failures:

```json
{
    "detail": "Appointments must be scheduled for future dates (at least tomorrow)."
}
```

```json
{
    "detail": "Maximum 20 appointments per day has been reached for 2025-07-17."
}
```

```json
{
    "detail": "Time slot 09:15 is already booked for 2025-07-17."
}
```

```json
{
    "detail": "Appointments must be scheduled in 20-minute intervals starting from 8:00 AM."
}
```

## Frontend Integration

To use this system in the frontend, update your API calls to use the new endpoints:

### JavaScript Example
```javascript
// Get available slots
const getAvailableSlots = async (date, campus = 'a') => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/appointments-v2/available_slots/?date=${date}&campus=${campus}`);
    return response.json();
};

// Create appointment with validation
const createAppointment = async (appointmentData) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/appointments-v2/', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(appointmentData)
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
        const error = await response.json();
        throw new Error(error.detail || 'Failed to create appointment');
    }
    
    return response.json();
};
```

## Migration Path

### Current System ‚Üí Enhanced System
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Old `/api/appointments/` endpoints remain functional
2. **Gradual Migration**: Use `/api/appointments-v2/` for new features
3. **Data Consistency**: Both systems work with the same database models

### Recommended Steps
1. Test the new system with `/api/appointments-v2/` endpoints
2. Update frontend components to use new validation rules
3. Implement time slot selection UI with 20-minute intervals
4. Add daily capacity indicators
5. Eventually migrate all frontend code to use v2 endpoints

## Benefits

### üéØ For Patients
- Clear time slot availability
- Prevents double-booking conflicts
- Predictable appointment duration (20 minutes)
- Better scheduling transparency

### üè• For Healthcare Staff
- Optimal appointment distribution throughout the day
- Controlled daily workload (maximum 20 patients)
- Efficient time management with standardized intervals
- Comprehensive booking statistics and analytics

### üìä For Administrators
- Real-time capacity monitoring
- Detailed utilization reports
- Flexible campus-based scheduling
- Robust validation preventing scheduling conflicts

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_appointment_scheduling.py
```

This script tests:
- Available slot retrieval
- Daily schedule display
- Booking statistics
- Validation rules (future dates, weekdays, time intervals, capacity limits)

## Configuration

The system parameters can be adjusted in `views2.py`:

```python
class AppointmentSchedulingViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    # Configuration constants
    MAX_APPOINTMENTS_PER_DAY = 20           # Daily appointment limit
    APPOINTMENT_DURATION_MINUTES = 20       # Time between appointments
    WORKING_HOURS_START = time(8, 0)        # 8:00 AM
    WORKING_HOURS_END = time(17, 0)         # 5:00 PM
    LUNCH_BREAK_START = time(12, 0)         # 12:00 PM
    LUNCH_BREAK_END = time(13, 0)           # 1:00 PM
```
