# Project Cleanup Complete ✅

## Files Successfully Deleted:

### Documentation Files:
- ✅ `EXPRESS_CLEANUP.md` - Temporary cleanup documentation
- ✅ `APPOINTMENT_SCHEDULING_SYSTEM.md` - Old implementation docs
- ✅ `DENTAL_APPOINTMENT_FLOW.md` - Old flow documentation
- ✅ `DENTAL_RECORD_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Old implementation docs  
- ✅ `RESCHEDULE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Old implementation docs

### Database & Migration Files:
- ✅ `migration_backup_1752598210/` - Old migration backup folder
- ✅ `check_migrations.py` - No longer needed migration script
- ✅ `rebuild_migrations.py` - No longer needed migration script
- ✅ `wmsu_health_db (1).sql` - Duplicate SQL file

### Batch Files:
- ✅ `start_backend.bat` - Old Express.js backend script
- ✅ `start_production.bat` - Old production script

### NPM Configuration:
- ✅ `package.json` - Root level npm config (not needed)
- ✅ `package-lock.json` - Root level npm lock (not needed)

### Executables:
- ✅ `ngrok.exe` (root level) - Duplicate removed
- ✅ `backend/ngrok.exe` - Backend copy removed

### ⚠️ Partial Cleanup:
- ⚠️ `node_modules/` - Some files locked by Windows (sharp library DLLs)
  - 3 DLL files couldn't be deleted due to Windows file locks
  - Safe to ignore or delete manually after restart

## Current Clean Project Structure:

```
wmsu-health-services/
├── .git/                    # Git repository
├── .gitignore              # Git ignore rules
├── backend/
│   └── django_api/         # Django REST API
├── frontend/               # Next.js React frontend
├── node_modules/           # (Partial - some locked files remain)
├── README.md               # Updated project documentation
├── start_dev.bat          # Development startup script
├── start_django_only.bat  # Django-only startup script
└── wmsu_health_db.sql     # Production database backup
```

## Benefits Achieved:

1. **Cleaner Repository** - Removed ~15 unnecessary files
2. **Clear Documentation** - No conflicting or outdated docs
3. **Simplified Structure** - Only essential files remain
4. **Reduced Confusion** - No old implementation references
5. **Focused Development** - Django-only backend architecture

## Note on node_modules:
The remaining `node_modules` folder has some locked DLL files from the Sharp image processing library. This is normal on Windows. You can:
- Ignore it (it's harmless)
- Restart your computer and delete manually
- Or leave it as the frontend might need some of these dependencies

Your project is now clean and ready for focused development! 🚀
