# Dental Waiver Implementation - Complete

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the dental waiver system for the WMSU Health Services platform. The dental waiver system requires users to sign an "Informed Consent to Care" document before booking dental appointments, similar to the existing general waiver system.

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
- **DentalWaiver Model**: Created in `backend/django_api/api/models.py`
  - Fields: patient, patient_name, guardian_name, guardian_signature, patient_signature, date_signed, user, school_year
  - Unique constraint on (user, school_year) to prevent duplicate waivers per academic year
  - Auto-populates user and school_year fields

- **DentalWaiverSerializer**: Created in `backend/django_api/api/serializers.py`
  - Handles serialization/deserialization of dental waiver data
  - Validates required fields based on patient age (guardian signature for minors)

- **DentalWaiverViewSet**: Created in `backend/django_api/api/views.py`
  - Full CRUD operations for dental waivers
  - Custom `check_status` endpoint at `/api/dental-waivers/check_status/`
  - Returns `{"has_signed": true/false}` based on current user's waiver status

- **API Endpoints**: Registered in `backend/django_api/api/urls.py`
  - `/api/dental-waivers/` - CRUD operations
  - `/api/dental-waivers/check_status/` - Check if current user has signed waiver

- **Database Migration**: Created `0045_add_dental_waiver_model.py`
  - Safely adds DentalWaiver table to existing database

### Frontend Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

#### 1. API Integration (`frontend/utils/api.ts`)
```typescript
export const dentalWaiversAPI = {
  create: (waiverData: any) => djangoApiClient.post('/dental-waivers/', waiverData),
  getAll: () => djangoApiClient.get('/dental-waivers/'),
  getById: (id: string | number) => djangoApiClient.get(`/dental-waivers/${id}/`),
  getByPatient: (patientId: string | number) => djangoApiClient.get(`/dental-waivers/?patient=${patientId}`),
  checkStatus: () => djangoApiClient.get('/dental-waivers/check_status/', {
    headers: { ...getAuthHeaders() },
  }),
};
```

#### 2. Dental Waiver Form (`frontend/pages/patient/dental-waiver.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Standalone page for signing the dental waiver
- **Features**:
  - Pre-filled patient name from localStorage
  - Digital signature pad using SignaturePad library
  - Print functionality
  - Auto-redirect if waiver already signed
  - Submission feedback with modal
  - Redirects to dental booking page after successful submission

- **Content**: "Informed Consent to Care" form specific to dental services
  - Covers risks, benefits, alternative treatments
  - Financial arrangements and cancellation policy
  - Privacy, emergency treatment, and medical history sections
  - Photography consent for documentation

#### 3. Enhanced Dental Booking (`frontend/pages/appointments/dental.tsx`)
- **Waiver Status Check**: Added on page load to verify if user has signed dental waiver
- **Conditional Flow**:
  - If waiver not signed: Redirects to dental waiver page when user attempts to book
  - If waiver signed: Shows green checkmark and allows normal booking flow
  - Loading state while checking waiver status

- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Loading spinner while checking waiver status
  - Notice badge showing waiver requirement status
  - Clear messaging about waiver requirement

## User Experience Flow

### New User (No Dental Waiver Signed)
1. User navigates to dental appointment booking page
2. System checks dental waiver status via API
3. User sees notice: "You will need to sign a dental waiver before your appointment can be processed"
4. User fills out appointment form and clicks "Submit Request"
5. System redirects to dental waiver page (`/patient/dental-waiver`)
6. User reads waiver content and provides digital signature
7. System saves waiver and redirects back to dental booking
8. User can now successfully book dental appointments

### Returning User (Dental Waiver Already Signed)
1. User navigates to dental appointment booking page
2. System checks dental waiver status via API
3. User sees confirmation: "✓ Dental waiver signed"
4. User can immediately book appointments without additional steps

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE api_dentalwaiver (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    patient_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    guardian_name VARCHAR(255),
    patient_signature TEXT NOT NULL,
    guardian_signature TEXT,
    date_signed DATE NOT NULL,
    patient_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES api_patient(id),
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES auth_user(id),
    school_year_id INTEGER REFERENCES api_academicschoolyear(id),
    UNIQUE(user_id, school_year_id)
);
```

### API Endpoints
- **GET** `/api/dental-waivers/check_status/` - Check current user's waiver status
- **POST** `/api/dental-waivers/` - Create new dental waiver
- **GET** `/api/dental-waivers/` - List all dental waivers (admin)
- **GET** `/api/dental-waivers/{id}/` - Get specific dental waiver
- **PUT/PATCH** `/api/dental-waivers/{id}/` - Update dental waiver
- **DELETE** `/api/dental-waivers/{id}/` - Delete dental waiver

### Security Considerations
- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only access their own waiver data
- Signature data is stored as base64 encoded images
- UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate waivers per academic year

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Backend API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Dental waiver page loads and functions properly
- [ ] Signature pad works and captures signatures
- [ ] Waiver status check works in dental booking page
- [ ] Redirect flow works correctly
- [ ] Error handling for network issues
- [ ] Print functionality works
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Test Files Created
- `test_dental_waiver_endpoints.py` - Backend API testing
- `test_dental_waiver_frontend.html` - Frontend integration testing

## Deployment Notes

### Database Migration
Run the following command to apply the dental waiver model:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Frontend Dependencies
Ensure SignaturePad library is installed:
```bash
npm install signature_pad
```

### Environment Requirements
- Django backend running on port 8000
- Next.js frontend running on port 3000
- Database with existing user and patient models

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **PDF Generation**: Generate PDF copies of signed waivers
2. **Email Notifications**: Send waiver confirmation emails
3. **Waiver Expiration**: Add automatic waiver expiration handling
4. **Multiple Languages**: Support for different language versions
5. **Waiver Versioning**: Handle updates to waiver content
6. **Analytics**: Track waiver completion rates

### Integration Opportunities
1. **General Waiver Integration**: Unified waiver management system
2. **Appointment History**: Link waivers to specific appointments
3. **Staff Dashboard**: View waiver completion status
4. **Reporting**: Generate waiver completion reports

## Conclusion

The dental waiver system has been successfully implemented and integrated into the existing WMSU Health Services platform. Users are now required to sign an "Informed Consent to Care" document before booking dental appointments, with the system remembering their waiver status to avoid redundant signatures.

The implementation follows the same patterns as the existing general waiver system while being specifically tailored for dental services. The system is secure, user-friendly, and maintainable.
