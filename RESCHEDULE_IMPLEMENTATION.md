# Appointment Reschedule Tracking Implementation

## Summary of Changes Made

This implementation adds comprehensive tracking for appointment reschedules to show users when their appointments have been rescheduled by admin staff.

### Backend Changes (Django API)

#### 1. Enhanced Appointment Model (`backend/django_api/api/models.py`)
- Added new fields to track reschedule information:
  - `is_rescheduled`: Boolean flag to indicate if appointment was rescheduled
  - `rescheduled_by`: Foreign key to the user who rescheduled
  - `rescheduled_at`: Timestamp of when reschedule occurred
  - `original_date`: Original appointment date before reschedule
  - `original_time`: Original appointment time before reschedule
  - `reschedule_reason`: Reason for rescheduling
  
- Added helper methods:
  - `reschedule_appointment()`: Properly reschedule with full tracking
  - `was_rescheduled_by_admin()`: Check if rescheduled by admin/staff
  - `was_rescheduled_by_patient()`: Check if rescheduled by patient

#### 2. Enhanced Appointment Serializer (`backend/django_api/api/serializers.py`)
- Added new read-only fields:
  - `rescheduled_by_name`: Name of user who rescheduled
  - `was_rescheduled_by_admin`: Boolean computed field
  - `was_rescheduled_by_patient`: Boolean computed field

#### 3. New API Endpoint (`backend/django_api/api/views.py`)
- Added `reschedule` action to `AppointmentViewSet`
- Endpoint: `POST /api/appointments/{id}/reschedule/`
- Proper permission checking and data validation
- Automatic note generation with reschedule details

#### 4. Database Migration
- Created migration `0032_appointment_is_rescheduled_appointment_original_date_and_more.py`
- Added all new fields to the database schema

### Frontend Changes (Next.js)

#### 1. Updated API Client (`frontend/utils/api.ts`)
- Added `reschedule` method to `appointmentsAPI`
- Uses the new dedicated reschedule endpoint

#### 2. Enhanced Appointment Interface (`frontend/pages/appointments/index.tsx`)
- Added new reschedule fields to the `Appointment` interface
- Enhanced `wasRescheduledByAdmin()` function to use backend fields
- Enhanced `wasRescheduledByPatient()` function to use backend fields
- Updated reschedule handler to use new API endpoint

#### 3. Improved Reschedule Display
- Shows detailed reschedule information for admin reschedules:
  - Who rescheduled the appointment
  - When it was rescheduled
  - Original date and time
  - Reason for rescheduling
- Shows different styling for patient vs admin reschedules
- Blue notification for admin reschedules
- Green notification for patient reschedules

#### 4. Updated Admin Pages
- Modified `frontend/pages/admin/medical-consultations.tsx`
- Modified `frontend/pages/admin/dental-consultations.tsx`
- Both now use the new reschedule API endpoint

### Key Features

1. **Full Audit Trail**: Every reschedule is tracked with who, when, and why
2. **User-Friendly Display**: Clear notifications show reschedule details
3. **Proper Permissions**: Only authorized users can reschedule appointments
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Falls back to note-based detection for old data
5. **Detailed Information**: Shows original vs new date/time, reason, and responsible party

### Usage

#### For Patients:
- Visit `/appointments` to see appointment status
- Rescheduled appointments show clear notifications
- Admin reschedules show as blue notifications with full details
- Patient reschedules show as green notifications with status

#### For Admins:
- Use the reschedule functionality in admin consultation pages
- All reschedules are properly tracked and logged
- Patients receive detailed notifications about changes

### Testing

Two test scripts were created to verify functionality:
- `test_reschedule.py`: Tests the model methods and database operations
- `test_api_reschedule_verified.py`: Tests the API endpoint functionality

Both tests passed successfully, confirming the implementation works correctly.

### Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Patients know exactly when and why their appointments were rescheduled
2. **Accountability**: Full audit trail of who made changes
3. **User Experience**: Clear, informative notifications
4. **Compliance**: Proper tracking for medical appointment management
5. **Flexibility**: Works for both patient and admin reschedules

This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for tracking and displaying appointment reschedules to users, ensuring transparency and improving the overall user experience.
