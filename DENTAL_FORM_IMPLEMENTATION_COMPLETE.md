  - Frontend: Field automatically disabled and populated from backend

### âœ… 3. Automatic Appointment Completion
- **Trigger**: When dental form is saved
- **Implementation**: `DentalFormData.save()` method automatically marks appointment as 'completed'

### âœ… 4. Optional Next Appointment Creation

- **Features**:
