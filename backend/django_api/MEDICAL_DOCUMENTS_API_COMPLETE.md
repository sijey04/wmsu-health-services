The backend is fully ready for frontend integration. The frontend can now:

1. **Display document upload interface** using `my_documents` endpoint
2. **Show document status and progress** with completion percentages
3. **Handle file uploads** via `update_my_documents` endpoint
4. **Submit for review** when documents are complete
5. **Show academic year selection** using academic years endpoints
6. **Staff dashboard** can list, verify, and manage all documents
7. **Generate and email certificates** through staff actions

## ðŸ”— Database Schema

All database tables are created and ready:
- âœ… `api_medicaldocument` - Main document storage
- âœ… `api_academicschoolyear` - Academic year management
- âœ… `api_dentalformdata` - Dental form records
- âœ… `api_medicalformdata` - Medical form records
- âœ… `api_patient` - Patient profiles with school year links

## ðŸ§ª Testing Status

The API has been tested and verified to work correctly with:
- âœ… Authentication and permissions
- âœ… CRUD operations for all models
- âœ… File upload functionality
- âœ… Academic year filtering
- âœ… Staff workflow actions
- âœ… Certificate generation
- âœ… Email delivery system

## ðŸ“ž Next Steps for Frontend

The frontend team can now:
1. Remove the "Feature Under Development" message
2. Implement the medical documents interface
3. Connect to the working API endpoints
4. Test the complete user workflow
5. Style the document management interface
