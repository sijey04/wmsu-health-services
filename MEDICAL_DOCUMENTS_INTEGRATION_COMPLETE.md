# Medical Documents System - Integration Complete

## Summary

The medical documents management system has been successfully integrated and debugged. The system is now fully operational with backend endpoints properly connected to the frontend admin interface.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Database Schema Fixed

- **Result**: All models now properly reference `AcademicSchoolYear` instead of the deprecated `AcademicSemester`

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

  - Document verification and rejection with reasons
  - Certificate issuance functionality
  - Email notifications for status changes
  - Academic year filtering
  - Patient-specific document access

### 6. API Integration

- `DELETE /api/medical-documents/{id}/` - Delete medical document
- `POST /api/medical-documents/{id}/verify/` - Verify document
- `POST /api/medical-documents/{id}/reject/` - Reject document
- `POST /api/medical-documents/{id}/issue_certificate/` - Issue certificate
- `POST /api/medical-documents/{id}/email_certificate/` - Email certificate
- `GET /api/academic-years/` - List academic years
- `GET /api/academic-years/current/` - Get current academic year

### Frontend Pages
- `/admin/medical-documents` - Admin interface for medical documents management

## Security Features
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Role-based access control (admin/staff only)
- CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Production Readiness
- ✅ Database schema is correct and optimized
- ✅ All migrations applied successfully
- ✅ API endpoints are fully functional
- ✅ Frontend integration is complete
- ✅ Error handling is comprehensive
- ✅ Authentication and authorization are properly implemented
- ✅ Debug code has been removed
- ✅ System has been tested end-to-end

## Next Steps
The system is now production-ready. Admin users can:
1. View all medical documents filtered by academic year
2. Verify or reject submitted documents
3. Issue medical certificates
4. Email certificates to patients
5. Track document submission status

The system properly handles academic year transitions and maintains data integrity across all operations.
