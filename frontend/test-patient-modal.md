# PatientProfileModal Update - Testing Guide

## Summary of Changes Made

The PatientProfileModal has been updated to work with the new unified patient profile system where:

1. **Each user now has only ONE patient profile** (no more per-semester duplicates)
2. **Academic periods are tracked through appointments** rather than separate patient profiles
3. **The modal now shows appointment history by academic year** instead of multiple profiles

## Key Changes:

### 1. Interface Updates
- Changed `allPatientProfiles?: Patient[]` to `appointments?: any[]`
- Removed profile selection logic, now uses academic year selection
- Updated navigation tabs from "Profile History" to "Medical Records"

### 2. New Features
- **Academic Year Selector**: Shows appointments grouped by academic year
- **Medical Records Tab**: Displays appointments and medical records for selected year
- **Summary Cards**: Shows appointment statistics for historical years
- **Appointment Timeline**: Shows chronological medical history

### 3. Backend Integration
- Updated to fetch appointments instead of multiple patient profiles
- Uses `/appointments/?patient={patientId}` endpoint
- Groups appointments by `school_year.academic_year`

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Open Patient Profile Modal
- Go to Admin → Patient Profile
- Click "View Profile" on any patient
- Modal should open showing patient information

### 2. Test Profile Tab
- Should show unified patient profile information
- Personal details, emergency contact, health info, medical history
- All data from the single patient profile

### 3. Test Medical Records Tab (if appointments exist)
- Tab should appear if patient has appointments
- Should show appointments grouped by academic year
- Academic year selector should allow switching between years
- Summary statistics should show for historical years

### 4. Test Academic Year Selection
- Dropdown should show "Current Year" and historical years
- Selecting different years should update the medical records display
- Should show appointment details with status, type, notes, etc.

## Expected Behavior

### With No Appointments
- Only "Patient Profile" tab visible
- Shows complete patient information
- No medical records section

### With Appointments
- Both "Patient Profile" and "Medical Records" tabs visible
- Medical Records tab shows appointment count
- Academic year selector shows available years
- Can switch between current and historical records

### Data Integration
- Patient profile data comes from unified Patient model
- Appointment data comes from Appointment model with school_year relationship
- Academic periods tracked through appointments, not separate profiles

## Verification Points

1. ✅ Modal opens without errors
2. ✅ Patient information displays correctly
3. ✅ Academic year selector works (if appointments exist)
4. ✅ Medical records show appointment details
5. ✅ Tab switching works smoothly
6. ✅ No references to old "multiple profiles" system
7. ✅ Summary statistics calculate correctly

This update aligns the frontend with the backend changes that consolidated patient profiles and moved academic period tracking to the appointment level.
