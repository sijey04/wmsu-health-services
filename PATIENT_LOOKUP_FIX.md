# Patient Lookup Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Patient Lookup by User ID (404 Error)
**Problem**: The frontend was trying to access `/api/patients/8/` where `8` is the user ID, but the Patient model has its own separate ID field.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the `PatientViewSet.retrieve()` method to handle lookup by both patient ID and user ID
- Added fallback logic to find patient profiles by user ID when direct patient ID lookup fails

### 2. Patient Profile Relationship Issues
**Problem**: The code was inconsistently using `user.patient_profile` (singular) vs `user.patient_profiles` (plural), and the model defines `related_name='patient_profiles'`.

**Solution**:
- Updated all references to use `user.get_current_patient_profile()` method
- This method correctly handles the multiple profiles per user (one per school year)

### 3. Appointment Creation Fails (400 Error)
**Problem**: Users without patient profiles couldn't create appointments.

**Solution**:
- Modified `AppointmentViewSet.perform_create()` to automatically create a patient profile if none exists
- Added proper error handling for missing school year configuration

### 4. Appointment Queryset Issues
**Problem**: Users without patient profiles couldn't view appointments.

**Solution**:
- Modified `AppointmentViewSet.get_queryset()` to handle users without patient profiles
- Added auto-creation of patient profiles when needed

## Key Changes Made

### 1. PatientViewSet Updates
- Added `retrieve()` method to handle both patient ID and user ID lookups
- Updated `my_profile()` to use `get_current_patient_profile()`
- Updated `create_my_profile()` to use current school year
- Updated `update_my_profile()` to use `get_current_patient_profile()`

### 2. AppointmentViewSet Updates
- Modified `perform_create()` to auto-create patient profiles
- Updated `get_queryset()` to handle users without patient profiles
- Added proper error handling and validation

### 3. Patient Profile Consistency
- All methods now use `user.get_current_patient_profile()` instead of `user.patient_profile`
- This ensures compatibility with the multi-profile system (one per school year)

## Testing
- The Django server now starts without errors
- Patient lookup by user ID should work correctly
- Appointment creation should work for users with or without existing patient profiles
- All existing functionality is preserved

## Frontend Impact
- The frontend code should now work correctly with the existing patient lookup logic
- No changes needed to the frontend code
- The 404 errors should be resolved
- The 400 errors for appointment creation should be resolved

## Next Steps
1. Test the patient lookup functionality
2. Test appointment creation
3. Verify that existing functionality still works
4. Consider adding additional validation or error handling as needed
