# Validation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Step-Specific Validation Errors
**Problem**: User was getting validation errors from steps 2 and 3 even when on step 1.

**Root Cause**: Validation logic was correctly step-specific, but errors from other steps could potentially leak through.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added step-specific error filtering to ensure only relevant errors are shown
- Clear field errors when navigating between steps (both forward and backward)
- Enhanced debugging to track validation flow

### 2. Profile Photo Validation 
**Problem**: Photo was required even for users with existing photos.

**Root Cause**: Photo validation wasn't properly detecting existing photos, especially edge cases like null strings.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced photo validation to properly detect existing photos
- Added checks for 'null' and 'undefined' string values
- Updated photo display logic to show existing photos
- Added comprehensive debugging for photo validation

## Code Changes:

### Validation Function (`validateStep`)
1. **Enhanced debugging**: Added step-by-step logging to track validation flow
2. **Step-specific error filtering**: Only return errors relevant to current step
3. **Robust photo detection**: Better checking for existing photos

### Navigation Functions
1. **`handleNext`**: Clear errors when moving to next step
2. **`handleBack`**: Clear errors when moving to previous step
3. **Enhanced debugging**: Log current step and validation calls

### Photo Display
1. **Existing photo detection**: Show existing photos in preview area
2. **Null value handling**: Properly handle edge cases

## Testing Instructions:
1. Load profile with existing data that has "Other" options selected
2. Verify no validation errors appear on step 1
3. Test photo upload for new users (should require photo)
4. Test photo display for existing users (should show existing photo, not require new one)
5. Verify step-specific validation only shows relevant errors

## Debug Output:
In development mode, console will show:
- Validation start/end markers
- Current step being validated
- Photo validation details
- Step-specific error filtering
- Navigation events

Remove debugging logs before production deployment.
