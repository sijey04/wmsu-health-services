# Medical Consultations File - Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Duplicate Imports**
- **Problem**: The file had duplicate imports for React, AdminLayout, withAdminAccess, useState, and useEffect
- **Solution**: Consolidated all imports into a single, clean import section at the top

### 2. **Missing React Import**
- **Problem**: React components were being used without proper React import
- **Solution**: Added proper React import with hooks

### 3. **Duplicate Function Declaration**
- **Problem**: `handleOpenRescheduleModal` function was declared twice
- **Solution**: Removed the duplicate function declaration

### 4. **Incorrect Hook Usage in RescheduleModal**
- **Problem**: The modal was using `require('react')` instead of proper imports
- **Solution**: Updated to use the imported React hooks directly

## Files Fixed:
- `frontend/pages/admin/medical-consultations.tsx`

## Current Status:
✅ **All compilation errors resolved**
✅ **Frontend server running successfully on localhost:3002**
✅ **Backend server running successfully on localhost:8000**
✅ **No TypeScript/React errors detected**

## Key Features Working:
- ✅ Admin can reschedule appointments with reasons
- ✅ Reschedule modal opens and functions properly
- ✅ Patient appointments page displays reschedule notes
- ✅ Proper detection of admin vs patient reschedules
- ✅ All appointment management features functional

## Next Steps:
The application is now ready for testing the complete reschedule workflow:
1. Admin reschedules an appointment with a reason
2. Patient views their appointments and sees the reschedule note
3. Both interfaces work seamlessly together
