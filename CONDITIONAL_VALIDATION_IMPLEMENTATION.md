# Conditional Validation Implementation

## Summary
Added conditional validation and improved user experience for specification fields in the patient profile setup form.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Validation Logic
Updated the `validateStep` function in `frontend/pages/patient/profile-setup.tsx` to include conditional validation for the following scenarios:

- **Past Medical History "Other"**: When "Other" is selected, the specification field is now required
- **Food Allergies**: When "Food Allergies" is selected in comorbid illnesses, the specification field is now required  
- **Comorbid Illnesses "Other"**: When "Other" is selected, the specification field is now required
- **Family Medical History "Other"**: When "Other" is selected, the specification field is now required
- **Family Medical History "Allergies"**: When "Allergies - Specify" is selected, the specification field is now required
- **Hospital Admission/Surgery Details**: When "Yes" is selected for hospital admission/surgery, the details field is now required

### 2. Improved Error Styling
All specification fields now include:
- Red border styling when validation errors occur
- Error messages displayed below the input fields
- Improved accessibility with proper error state indication

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- More descriptive placeholder text for all specification fields
- Better visual feedback for required fields
- Consistent styling across all conditional input fields

## Validation Rules

### Conditional Requirements
1. **Past Medical History**: If "Other" is checked → `past_medical_history_other` is required
2. **Food Allergies**: If "Food Allergies" is checked → `food_allergy_specify` is required
3. **Comorbid Illnesses**: If "Other" is checked → `other_comorbid_specify` is required
4. **Family Medical History**: If "Other" is checked → `family_medical_history_other` is required
5. **Family Medical History**: If "Allergies - Specify" is checked → `family_medical_history_allergies` is required
6. **Hospital Admission/Surgery**: If "Yes" is selected → `hospital_admission_details` is required

### Error Messages
- Past Medical History Other: "Please specify the other medical condition."
- Food Allergies: "Please specify the food allergies."
- Comorbid Illnesses Other: "Please specify the other illness."
- Family Medical History Other: "Please specify the other family medical condition."
- Family Medical History Allergies: "Please specify the allergies."
- Hospital Admission Details: "Please provide details about the hospital admission or surgery."

## Technical Implementation

### Validation Function
```typescript
// Conditional validation for "Other" in past medical history
if (Array.isArray(profile?.past_medical_history) && profile.past_medical_history.includes('Other')) {
  if (!profile?.past_medical_history_other || profile.past_medical_history_other.trim() === '') {
    errors.past_medical_history_other = 'Please specify the other medical condition.';
  }
}

// Similar patterns for other conditional fields...
```

### Error Styling Pattern
```tsx
<input
  type="text"
  placeholder="Specify the medical condition"
  className={`block w-3/4 border rounded-lg shadow-sm py-1 px-2 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#800000] focus:border-[#800000] ${fieldErrors.past_medical_history_other ? 'border-red-500' : 'border-gray-300'}`}
  value={profile?.past_medical_history_other || ''}
  onChange={e => handleProfileChange('past_medical_history_other', e.target.value)}
/>
{fieldErrors.past_medical_history_other && <div className="text-red-500 text-xs mt-1">{fieldErrors.past_medical_history_other}</div>}
```

## Testing

The validation has been tested to ensure:
- All conditional fields are properly validated
- Error styling is applied correctly
- Error messages are displayed appropriately
- User experience is improved with descriptive placeholders
- Form submission is blocked when required conditional fields are empty

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/pages/patient/profile-setup.tsx` - Main implementation file with validation logic and UI improvements

## Impact

This implementation ensures that users provide necessary details when selecting "Other" options or answering "Yes" to specific medical questions, improving data quality and completeness of patient profiles.
